  ## Description:  
  For this assignment, we were tasked with creating a progressive web app that would function when the client isn't connected to the internet. The app allows a user to track expenses and deposits, and when a new transaction is added, a new balance is rendered. When the user's browser lose connection with the internet, they can still enter new transactions and update their balance. When reconnecting to the internet, the data saved in the browser will sync up with the server.

  ## Challenges:  
  The biggest challenge in this app was going through and understanding the code to implement the indexed DB and cache the public files. After going over the code multiple times, I was able to understand how it was working to save the necessary information to allow the user to continue entering and saving data in the app.
